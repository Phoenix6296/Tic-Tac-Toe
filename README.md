Given version of project has some of the issues listed below-
1)It was not responsive i.e; it was not a flexible website and can only be viewed on large size devices such as desktop.
2)It was not user friendly because there was no sound effect.
3)There was no score table that can show the score of the Players X and O.
4)In the given project "onclick()" was used which is not good according to security hazards. EventLintner is a much better option.

Changes made by me-

All the above mentioned error are rectified.


-----HAPPY CODING-----
