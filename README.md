Given version of project has some of the issues listed below-
1)It was not responsive i.e; it was not a flexible website and can only be viewed on large size devices such as desktop.
2)Sound effect makes a game much more attractive and in the given link of project there were no sound effects.
3)There was no score table that can show the score of the Players X and O.

Changes made by me-

All the above mentioned error are rectified.


-----HAPPY CODING-----
